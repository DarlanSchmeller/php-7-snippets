# Curso PHP – Snippets & Hands-On

This repository houses the PHP snippets and sample code I created while taking a PHP 7 course on Udemy. It helped me get comfortable with PHP’s syntax, features and paradigms by working through many small exercises.

## 🚀 What’s inside

A breakdown of the folder structure:

- variaveis/ — playing with variables, types, assignment and basic operations
- tipos/ — diving into the different PHP types (string, integer, array, object, etc.)
- repeticoes/ — loops: for, while, foreach and controlling flow
- funcoes/ — defining and calling functions, using arguments and return values
- orientacaoobjetos/ — basic OOP in PHP: classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces
- includes/ — working with file inclusion (include, require) and modularising code
- sessao_cookies/ — managing sessions and cookies in PHP
- db/ — simple interactions with a database (connect, query, fetch)
- filesupload/ — sample code for handling file uploads via PHP
- formulario/ — building and validating web forms in PHP
- controle/ — control structures (if/else, switch) and other flow logic
- plus some extra example scripts at the root (index.php, login.php, etc).

## ✅ Purpose & Use

- To document my learning journey in PHP (and be able to revisit later)
- To serve as reference snippets for typical PHP tasks
- For anyone curious about PHP syntax, simple tasks or beginner code – you are welcome to explore

## 🎯 How to Explore

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/DarlanSchmeller/php-7-snippets.git
```

3. Navigate through the folders listed above to find topics of interest.

4. Run the .php files on your local PHP environment (PHP 7+) or a simple local server (like XAMPP, MAMP, etc).

5. Modify, extend or experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

## 💡 What I Learned

- How PHP handles variables, types and operators
- Writing functions and basic OOP in PHP
- Handling web-forms, uploading files, managing sessions and cookies
- Working with includes, modularisation, and simple database connectivity
- Flow control (loops, conditionals) and organizing code in meaningful structure
